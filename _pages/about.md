Hi, I'm Pavel.

I'm a co-founder and CTO of [ProperLot](https://properlot.com). We help Texas homeowners to protest their property value with the local Appraisal Board. This process is known as "Property Tax Protest".

In 2012, I co-founded and served as CTO of [Student Loan Hero](https://studentloanhero.com). The company helps people to manage and eliminate student loans & personal debt by providing education materials, loan calculators and other tools. We were acquired by [LendingTree](https://lendingtree.com) in 2018.

In my [blog](/) I share my experience in software development, devops, startups and other things of my interest. Don't hesitate to check it out.
